# Linear notes
## Features
- good clicky and kbd interfaces for creating, tagging, and changing the state of issues 
- super/ctrl k for all cmds, good for looking up commands' keybind
- connect github to link issues and PRs with **one or more repos**
  - move issues from In Progress to Done automatically so you never have to update issues manually (requires specific naming practices on issues and PRs)
- plugins for things like roadmaps, cycles, and custom views
- reusable templates

## testing github integration
- create naive github issue: does nothing
